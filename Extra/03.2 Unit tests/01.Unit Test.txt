-- The @RunWith(JUnit4.class) annotation indicates the runner that will be used to run the tests in this class. 
-- A test runner is a library or set of tools that enables testing to occur and the results to be printed to a log. 
-- The @SmallTest annotation indicates that all the tests in this class are unit tests that have no dependencies,
   and run in milliseconds.
-- The @SmallTest, @MediumTest, and @LargeTest annotations are conventions that make it easier to bundle groups 
   of tests into suites of similar functionality.
-- The setUp() method is used to set up the environment before testing, and includes the @Before annotation. 

NOTE
-- you can only test a method that are public or package protected.

ASSERT
--Assertions are expressions that must evaluate and result in TRUE for the test to pass.
-- The assertThat() method is used with matchers. Matchers are the chained method calls 
   in the second operand of this assertion.

CLOSETO
-- With the closeTo() matcher, rather that testing for exact equality you can test for equality within a specific delta.
-- Delta specefy the closeness , close to take its result true if precision lies within the specified delta.
EXAMPLE
	@Test
public void givenADouble_whenCloseTo_thenCorrect() {
    double actual = 1.3;
    double operand = 1;--operand bhaneko aagadi ko value.
    double error = 0.5;-- delta bhaneko pachadi ko value.
--the actuall value must fall in between operand and delta
  
    assertThat(actual, closeTo(operand, error));
}
As 1.3 is between 0.5 and 1.5, the test will pass. Same way, we can test the negative scenario:
